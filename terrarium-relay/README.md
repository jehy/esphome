# Terrarium relay

ESPHome config for terrarium relays, which can provide light, heat and humidifier.

Later I replaced it with **terrarium-dimmer** project because dimmer is more reliable then relay.

It's just a simple multichannel relay config with additional lambda function to self disable relay in case Home Assistant crashed.

You can use automation sample from terrarium-dimmer project for relays as well.
